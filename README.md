# area_code

i was taking what i've learned about methods and hashes and was asked to create a directory of cities with their zip codes and then 
prompt the user to identify which city they wanted to look up the zip code for, and then give them the answer based on the hash.

the program is supposed to continue to ask them if they want to look up a new city until they say 'no'
